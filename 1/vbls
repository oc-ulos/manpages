\h1NAME
\i1vbls - the Vaguely Bourne-Like Shell

\h1SYNOPSIS
\i1\byvbls\bn
\i1\byvbls\bn [\scoptions\sd] [\syscript\sd [\sgarguments\sd]]

\h1DESCRIPTION
\i1\byvbls\bn is a fairly simple shell written in Lua.  It is theoretically saner than GNU Bash.  Its syntax is somewhat more forgiving.

\h1SYNTAX
\i1In its basic syntax \byvbls\bn is very similar to Bash.  Most simple command pipelines translate directly between the two; the primary difference is that \byvbls\bn does not support job control, so single instances of the \by&\bn character have no special meaning.

\i1Comments in Bash and in \byvbls\bn are exactly the same: starting with a \by#\bn and continuing to the end of the line.

\i1\h2Flow Control
\i1\byvbls\bn differs most greatly from Bash in its implementation of programming constructs.  Usually the difference is a lack of semicolons:  where in Bash an \byif\bn statement takes the form:

\i2\syif \sccommand\sy; then
\i3\sb# do something
\i2\syfi\sd

\i1...that same condition looks like this in \byvbls\bn.

\i2\syif \sccommand \sythen
\i3\sb# do something
\i2\syend\sd

\i1\byfor\bn loops MUST take the form \syfor \scvariable\sy in \sctokens ...\sy do\sd ...
